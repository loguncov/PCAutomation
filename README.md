# Arduino AutoConfig
This project provides an Arduino script to automate the installation and setup process of programs on a computer. The goal of this script is to save time and provide convenience when setting up a new device or transferring settings to another device.
## Features:
- Uses Arduino to emulate keypresses and automate actions on the computer.
- Includes steps for creating necessary folders, downloading files from the internet, and installing them.
- Ability to configure programs automatically and set them to run on startup for user convenience.
## How to Use:
1. Connect Arduino to your computer.
2. Upload the script to Arduino using Arduino IDE.
3. Run the script to automatically perform all necessary steps on your computer.
## Notes:
- Ensure your Arduino is properly connected and recognized by your computer.- All required programs and files must be in the specified locations for the script to function correctly.

- Please pay close attention to the order of actions to avoid errors or unexpected changes on your computer.
